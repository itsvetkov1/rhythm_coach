# Progress Log

## Learnings
(Patterns discovered during implementation)

- RhythmAnalyzer.analyzeAudio() is the main public API that needs debug parameters
- Mock classes in test files must match the exact signature including optional parameters
- Debug logging should use StringBuffer for efficient string concatenation
- path_provider is already available in pubspec.yaml for file operations
- The _detectOnsets method now returns List<Map<String, double>> with 'time' and 'confidence' keys
- Flutter analyze shows 113 lint warnings (avoid_print) but no errors
- WAV file format: RIFF header, chunks (fmt, data), little-endian encoding
- AudioFixtureLoader utility class available for loading test audio files in tests
- Test audio fixtures located in test/fixtures/audio/ directory

---

## Iteration 1 - Add diagnostic instrumentation to RhythmAnalyzer
- Implemented US-001 from PRD.md
- Added debugMode and debugOutputPath optional parameters to analyzeAudio()
- Created internal log() function that conditionally writes to StringBuffer
- Updated _detectOnsets() to return onset data with confidence scores (normalized flux values)
- Added detailed debug logging:
  - FFT configuration (size, hop, sample rate)
  - Spectral flux values for first 20 frames
  - Threshold values and noise floor
  - All detected onset times with confidence scores
  - Frame processing statistics
- Implemented _saveDebugLog() method to write timestamped files to app documents directory
- Updated mock classes in headphones_routing_test.dart and start_practice_test.dart
- Typecheck passes with no new errors

Files changed:
- lib/services/rhythm_analyzer.dart (main implementation)
- test/features/audio/headphones_routing_test.dart (mock update)
- test/features/practice/start_practice_test.dart (mock update)
- PRD.md (marked US-001 complete)

Learnings for future iterations:
- Debug instrumentation is critical for understanding algorithm behavior
- Confidence scores (spectral flux values) will be useful for tuning thresholds
- The first 20 frames of logging provides good insight without overwhelming output
- Future tasks should use this debug mode when testing new onset detection algorithms

## Iteration 2 - Create synthetic test audio files
- Implemented US-002 from PRD.md
- Created tool/generate_test_audio.dart script to generate three test fixtures:
  - test_silence.wav: 5 seconds of digital silence (all zero samples)
  - test_white_noise.wav: 5 seconds of low-level white noise (RMS ~0.05)
  - test_drum_hits.wav: 8 impulse hits at 120 BPM with exponential decay
- All files generated as 44.1kHz, mono, PCM 16-bit WAV with proper headers
- Created AudioFixtureLoader utility class (test/test_utils/audio_fixture_loader.dart)
  - Parses WAV file format and extracts PCM samples
  - Normalizes int16 samples to Float64List (-1.0 to 1.0 range)
  - Includes comprehensive tests verifying fixture characteristics
- All tests pass, typecheck passes (113 lint warnings, no errors)

Files changed:
- tool/generate_test_audio.dart (new - audio generation script)
- test/fixtures/audio/test_silence.wav (new - 431KB)
- test/fixtures/audio/test_white_noise.wav (new - 431KB)
- test/fixtures/audio/test_drum_hits.wav (new - 388KB)
- test/test_utils/audio_fixture_loader.dart (new - WAV parser utility)
- test/test_utils/audio_fixture_loader_test.dart (new - verification tests)
- PRD.md (marked US-002 complete)

Learnings for future iterations:
- WAV file format: RIFF header, then chunks (fmt, data), little-endian encoding
- Dart requires 'dart:math' import for sqrt() function
- Const expressions cannot include method calls like .round()
- The test audio generator creates realistic drum hits with multiple frequency components
- AudioFixtureLoader can be used in all future onset detection tests

---

## Iteration 3 - Add automated tests for false positive prevention
- Implemented US-003 from PRD.md
- Created test/services/rhythm_analyzer_false_positive_test.dart with 4 test cases:
  - Test 1: Verifies test_silence.wav produces zero detections (PASSES - RMS energy filter already working)
  - Test 2: Verifies test_white_noise.wav produces zero detections (FAILS with 8 false positives - expected)
  - Test 3: Verifies test_drum_hits.wav detects 8 onsets ±1 (FAILS with 0 detections due to metronome bleed check)
  - Test 4: Diagnostic summary showing false positive rate across all fixtures
- Tests use existing test fixtures from test/fixtures/audio/
- Tests demonstrate the false positive problem: white noise triggers 8 false detections
- Drum hits trigger metronome bleed check (1.77ms consistency - too precise for synthetic audio)
- Typecheck passes (121 lint warnings pre-existing, no errors)

Files changed:
- test/services/rhythm_analyzer_false_positive_test.dart (new - automated false positive tests)
- PRD.md (marked US-003 complete)

Learnings for future iterations:
- The existing RMS energy check successfully filters complete silence (RMS < 0.001)
- White noise with RMS ~0.05 passes energy check but triggers 8 false positives
- Synthetic drum hits are too precise (1.77ms consistency) and trigger metronome bleed detection
- The metronome bleed check (consistency < 3ms) is working as designed but blocks synthetic test data
- Future implementations should either:
  1. Add jitter to synthetic drum hits to avoid metronome bleed check, OR
  2. Add a parameter to disable metronome bleed check for testing purposes
- The diagnostic summary test provides valuable visibility into false positive rates

## Iteration 4 - Implement noise floor measurement
- Implemented US-004 from PRD.md
- Added _measureNoiseFloor(List<double> samples) method to RhythmAnalyzer
  - Uses first 1 second of audio (44100 samples) for noise measurement
  - Calculates RMS energy of noise sample
  - Returns noise floor value (0.0 to 1.0 scale)
  - Handles edge cases: empty samples, audio shorter than 1 second
- Created comprehensive unit tests in test/services/rhythm_analyzer_noise_floor_test.dart:
  - Test 1: Complete silence returns 0.0
  - Test 2: Low-level noise calculates correct RMS
  - Test 3: Uses only first 1 second (ignores later loud sections)
  - Test 4: Handles audio shorter than 1 second
  - Test 5: Empty sample list returns 0.0
  - Test 6: Known signal (sine wave) produces expected RMS value
- All 6 tests pass
- Typecheck passes (122 lint warnings pre-existing, no errors)

Files changed:
- lib/services/rhythm_analyzer.dart (added _measureNoiseFloor method)
- test/services/rhythm_analyzer_noise_floor_test.dart (new - 6 unit tests)
- PRD.md (marked US-004 complete)

Learnings for future iterations:
- Noise floor measurement provides the foundation for adaptive thresholding
- Using first 1 second ensures we sample ambient noise before any drumming starts
- RMS calculation can be reused from existing _calculateRMS() method
- Tests use flutter_test package (not dart:test)
- Helper function _measureNoiseFloorPublic() in test duplicates logic to test private method
- Min function requires dart:math import (already imported in rhythm_analyzer.dart)
- Future tasks (US-007) will use this noise floor value to calculate adaptive thresholds
---

## Iteration 5 - Implement high-pass filter preprocessing
- Implemented US-005 from PRD.md
- Added _applyHighPassFilter(List<double> samples, double cutoffHz) method to RhythmAnalyzer
  - Implements first-order recursive high-pass filter
  - Filter equation: y[n] = alpha * (y[n-1] + x[n] - x[n-1])
  - Alpha coefficient calculated from cutoff frequency (60 Hz) and sample rate
  - Removes DC offset and attenuates frequencies below cutoff
- Created comprehensive unit tests in test/services/rhythm_analyzer_high_pass_test.dart:
  - Test 1: DC offset removal (constant signal becomes zero)
  - Test 2: Low-frequency attenuation (30Hz sine wave reduced >50%)
  - Test 3: High-frequency preservation (500Hz sine wave >80% preserved)
  - Test 4: Mixed signal handling (DC removed, high freq preserved)
  - Test 5: Empty samples returns empty list
  - Test 6: Filter maintains correct sample count
- All 6 tests pass
- Typecheck passes (123 lint warnings pre-existing, no errors)

Files changed:
- lib/services/rhythm_analyzer.dart (added _applyHighPassFilter method)
- test/services/rhythm_analyzer_high_pass_test.dart (new - 6 unit tests)
- PRD.md (marked US-005 complete)

Learnings for future iterations:
- First-order high-pass filters have transient response at the start (need to skip initial samples when measuring)
- Filter coefficient alpha determines cutoff: approaches 1.0 for lower cutoff, 0.0 for higher cutoff
- The filter equation maintains state (previousInput, previousOutput) across samples
- Testing signal processing requires checking steady-state behavior (skip transient at start)
- Helper function pattern continues: duplicate private method logic in test for testing
- This filter will be integrated into the onset detection pipeline (US-009) to preprocess audio before FFT
---

## Iteration 6 - Implement improved spectral flux calculation
- Implemented US-006 from PRD.md
- Created new _calculateSpectralFlux(List<double>, List<double>) method in RhythmAnalyzer
  - Calculates frequency bin resolution from FFT parameters
  - Focuses on drum hit frequency range (200Hz-8000Hz)
  - Ignores bins below 200Hz (rumble, handling noise)
  - Ignores bins above 8000Hz (electronic noise, aliasing)
  - Uses Half-Wave Rectification (only counts energy increases)
  - Applies frequency weighting: 1.0 for 200-4kHz, 0.5 for 4-8kHz
  - Normalizes flux by previous frame energy
- Refactored _detectOnsets() to extract inline spectral flux calculation into separate method
- Created comprehensive unit tests in test/services/rhythm_analyzer_spectral_flux_test.dart:
  - Test 1: Verifies low-frequency rumble (<200Hz) is ignored
  - Test 2: Verifies drum hit frequencies (200-4000Hz) produce positive flux
  - Test 3: Verifies high-frequency noise (>8000Hz) is ignored
  - Test 4: Verifies half-wave rectification (energy decreases ignored)
  - Test 5: Verifies reduced weight for 4-8kHz range vs core drum range
  - Test 6: Verifies zero energy handling
  - Test 7: Verifies normalized flux values are in reasonable range
- All 7 tests pass
- Typecheck passes (only pre-existing avoid_print warnings and expected unused_element warnings for future tasks)

Files changed:
- lib/services/rhythm_analyzer.dart (added _calculateSpectralFlux method, refactored _detectOnsets)
- test/services/rhythm_analyzer_spectral_flux_test.dart (new - 7 comprehensive unit tests)
- PRD.md (marked US-006 complete)

Learnings for future iterations:
- Frequency-weighted spectral flux is a key improvement for reducing false positives
- FFT bin resolution = (sampleRate / 2) / (fftSize / 2) = 21.53 Hz per bin for 44.1kHz / 2048 FFT
- Focusing on 200-8kHz range eliminates most noise while capturing drum hits
- Drum hits have primary energy in 200-4kHz range, so this gets full weight
- 4-8kHz range contains cymbal energy and some drum harmonics, so gets reduced weight (0.5)
- The helper function pattern (duplicating private method logic in tests) continues to work well
- _measureNoiseFloor and _applyHighPassFilter show as unused - expected until US-009 integration
